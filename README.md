# Rich presence-Status-Changer
#### Disclaimer
This is not standalone and is just an addon to AutoStartRichPresence

# Tutorial

1. Copy the **.exe** file to your **plugins folder** and make a shortcut to run from somewhere else. For example your desktop.
2. In discord, edit your rich presence to look like you want it to when you are playing something. For example valorant.
3. Go into your **plugins folder** and **copy** your **AutoStartRichPresence.plugin.js** file and **renamed** it to 0.*name of game*.json.

## example
If the presence you made is for valorant, name it this.

0.*valorant*.json

## Important

After you run the **.exe** and select your status you will still need to **reload discord**.
This can be done by **pressin ctrl + r** inside the discord app.
